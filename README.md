### drag + command key
Drag with the command key pressed to move the tangent points to make the flats longer or shorter.

### drag + option key
Drag with the option key pressed to move the control points. The tool snaps to the bcp factor that corresponds to standard ellipses.

The horizontal and vertical values flip when the dragged rectangle goes from ▬ to ▐ and vice versa.
